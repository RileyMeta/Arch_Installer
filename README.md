# Arch_Installer
A Custom Arch Linux Installer completely written in Bash

## This is a personal project and should not be used for anything more than learning.
I am not a competent software engineer (yet), and while I am confident that this script will finish successfully with a correct install, but I have yet to add in "fail safes" to make sure the script stops if necessary values are not set.
I am still working on this as a personal project. 

## I heavily support learning through open-source
If anyone wants to take this and make their own installer with it, possibly wrap it with Dialog or another TUI/GUI interface, by all means you have my full support.

> This is just my project to learn Bash and experiment with User Inputs.
