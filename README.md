# Arch_Installer
A Custom Arch Linux Installer completely written in Bash

## I heavily support learning through open-source
If anyone wants to take this and make their own installer with it, possibly wrap it with Dialog or another TUI/GUI interface, by all means you have my full support.

> This is just my project to learn Bash and experiment with User Inputs.
